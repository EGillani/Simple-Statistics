# Simple-Statistics

<<<<<<< HEAD
This was a project to familarize with syntax, file I/O streams, structs, and dynamic memory allocation in C. Tried to really understand the importance of allocating memory with realloc and malloc. How to generate a list without the existance of vectors, etc.  This program can be run in command line (just run the exe in the debug folder with a sample text file) with x, y pairs. Perform basic statistics on the text file and generate an output on the command line. There is also some other text files if you want to try it out with other text files than the one I'm using in the debug folder.

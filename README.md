# Simple-Statistics

This was a project to familarize with syntax, file I/O streams, structs, and dynamic memory allocation in C. Tried to really understand the importance of allocating memory with realloc and malloc or how to generate a list without vectors, etc.  This program can be run in command line (just run the exe in the debug folder with a sample text file) with x, y pairs. Perform basic statistics on the text file and generate an output on the command line.
